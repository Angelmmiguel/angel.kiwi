Sometimes you need to record videos or demos that involves the terminal. Typing the commands is difficult, as you may miss-type or forget a specific command. 

Today, I wanted to record a small demo for the Wasm Workers Server project. Instead of typing the commands, I tried to write a simple script to print and run them. However, the result was messy.

Fortunately, I found [demo-magic](https://github.com/paxtonhare/demo-magic), a bash script to emulate typing and prepare neat terminal demos. It comes with multiple helper methods. For exampl:

- `p`: emulate typing a command
- `pe`: emulate typing a command, wait you to press "Enter" and run the command
- `pei`: emulate typing a command and run the command
- `wait`: wait until you press "Enter"
- `cmd`: give control back to you to type and run commands manually

The demo look and feel can be customized. You can configure the prompt (`DEMO_PROMPT`) and the waiting timeout (`WAIT_TIMEOUT`). You can find [a sample script](https://github.com/paxtonhare/demo-magic/blob/master/samples/demo-template.sh) in the repository. 

[The result was pretty neat](https://twitter.com/vmwwasm/status/1628827270369488901)! The tool is simple, although I needed some practice with the different methods and the waiting periods ðŸ“¹.feat
