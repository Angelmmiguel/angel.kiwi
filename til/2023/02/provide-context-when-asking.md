**Asking questions is one of those underrated skills**. When you ask a question, you expect to get clarity or new information about a topic. Ensuring that other people understand your question and your context, may help to properly transfer the information.

Today, I was reading about this on the [Software Engineering at Google](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/software-engineering-at/9781492082781/) book. In the culture chapter, they recommended the amazing ["How to ask good questions"](https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions/) article from [Julie Evans](https://social.jvns.ca/@b0rk). 

I really loved this tip:

> "State what you know. This is one of my favorite question-asking techniques! This kind of question basically takes the for: 
> 
> 1. State what you understand about the subject so far
> 1. Ask “is that right?”
>
> From [Julie Evans](https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions/)

I used this tecnique in the latest conversation I had with a teammate. It was really useful. **I could confirm my current knowledge and my teammate went directly to the response I needed**. 

I cannot wait to put more tips in practice!
