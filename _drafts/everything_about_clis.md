# Everything I know to build CLIs

Lately, I started working on a new CLI. As an engineer, I've been working with CLIs over long time, and also have a chance to design and build several ones. As any other interface, CLIs are a medium to help developers completing a certain task they have in mind. 

CLIs are minimalistic. A well designed CLI helps you completing your task, guide you, and repeat over an over. They are both the first entrypoint for new developers and the advanced tools for experts. This is why I love them, they are your perfect teammate.
