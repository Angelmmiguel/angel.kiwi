3 years ago, the company I was working for, [Bitnami](https://bitnami.com/), was acquired by [VMware](https://blogs.vmware.com/cloud/2019/05/15/vmware-to-acquire-bitnami/). As a worker, going through a company acquisition is a roller coaster experience. You see team mates leaving, the focus changes, old projects are closed, and new ones emerge.

During these 3 years, I have been working on [VMware Application Catalog](https://tanzu.vmware.com/application-catalog). This was a fascinating challenge. I may highlight some of the responsibilities I took during this time:

- Conceptualizing and designing the first versions
- Leading the UI development
- Filling the gap between the product and design teams, and engineering
- Enabling the collaboration with other teams
- Etc

However, if I need to highlight just one thing from this experience, it would be **the team**. We learned together, grew personally and professionally, supported each other, built a product, and provided value to our customers. I'll miss working with them a lot.

# Why a change?

You may not know me, but **I'm a curious person**. Even though my focus is on the UI, I enjoyed working on APIs, Kubernetes, Monitoring, and other topics during this time. When working on a product, new features require all your attention, and the time to explore new things is drastically reduced.

Since last year, **I've been missing exploring and learning new things**. In addition to that, the new challenges and the next steps for the product were not very aligned with my personal goals. So, after giving some time to myself, I decided **it was the moment for a change**.

# What's next?

This is the exact question I asked myself at the beginning of this year. Then, I started looking for a position that offered me time to explore, discover, build, succeed and fail quickly.

Fortunately, the tech industry has a vast set of available roles. Considering those goals, I found three main areas that fit my wishlist in different grades:

- Developer Experience (DX)
- Developer Advocacy
- Innovation

Without pressure, I could take the time to look for opportunities in different companies. All the interview processes were quite well, and I had a chance to meet amazing people.

So, what's next?

# My next chapter is WASM!

After some thoughtful days, I decided to join the [Office of the CTO](https://octo.vmware.com/) (OCTO) team in VMware ðŸ¥³! I will work with [Daniel](https://twitter.com/vomkriege) and [Jesus](https://es.linkedin.com/in/jesusgm) on [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) (WASM). Our goal is to learn, build projects, share knowledge and explore the potential of WASM. A perfect mix for this new chapter.

I'm really excited about this new adventure. You can expect much more activity around.

See you all! ðŸ‘‹

PS: We're hiring ðŸ˜‰
