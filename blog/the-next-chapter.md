3 years ago, the company I was working for, [Bitnami](https://bitnami.com/), was acquired by [VMware](https://blogs.vmware.com/cloud/2019/05/15/vmware-to-acquire-bitnami/). As a worker, going through an acquisition is an roller coaster experience. You see team mates leaving, the focus changes, old projects are closed and new ones emerge.

During these 3 years, I have been working on [VMware Application Catalog](https://tanzu.vmware.com/application-catalog). This was an amazing challenge. I may highlight some of the responsibilities I took during this time:

- Conceptualizing and designing the first versions
- Leading the UI development
- Filling the gap between the product and design teams, and engineering
- Enabling the collaboration with other teams
- Etc

However, if I need to highlight just one thing from these years it would be **the team**. We learnt together, grew personally and professionally, supported each other, built a product, put it in front of customers and iterate over it.

Developing and shipping a product as one team is the achievement I am most proud of :)

# Why a change?

You may not know me, but **I'm a very curious person**. This is the reason why during this time I learnt about APIs, Kubernetes, Monitoring, and other random topics. When working on a product, new features require 100% your attention and the time to explore new things is drastically reduced.

Since last year, **I've been missing exploring and learning new things a lot**. The new challenges and the next steps for the team were not very attractive for me. So, after giving some time to myself, I decided **this is the time for a change**.

# What's next?

This is the exact question I asked to myself at the beginning of this year. I decided to look for a job position in which I will have time to explore, discover, build, try and fail quickly.

Fortunately, the tech industry has a vast set of available roles. So, thinking on that constraint I found three main areas that fit my wishlist in different grades:

- Developer Experience (DX)
- Developer Advocacy
- Innovation

Without pressure, I could take the time to look for different opportunities and interview in different companies. All the interview processes were quite well and I had a change to meet amazing people.

# My next chapter is WASM!

After some thoughtful days, I decided to join the [Office of the CTO](https://octo.vmware.com/) (OCTO) team in VMware ðŸ¥³! I will join a new team with [Daniel](https://twitter.com/vomkriege) and [Jesus](https://es.linkedin.com/in/jesusgm) to focus on [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) (WASM). By the way, we're hiring ðŸ˜‰.

Our goal is to learn, explore, build projects, share knowledge and understand the potential of WASM. This fits on the innovation area and it is aligned with my next chapter idea.

I'm really excited for this new adventure. You can expect much more activity around.

See you all! ðŸ‘‹
