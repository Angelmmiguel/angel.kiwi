So, here we go again!

New blog, new design and new content. This site was in my todo list for long time. Actually, I have to update the illustration in the home page as I changed my hair style 1 year ago. Many things happen during the last year (COVID 😅), so I didn´t find the energy and motivation to design and develop until now.

## Why a new blog in late 2021?

To be honest, I don't remember the last time I wrote an article for my previos blog and it's something I'm missing. Writing helped me a lot in the past. Every article brought me many good things:

- ✏️ Improve English
- 🧑‍🚀 Learn new things
- 📚 Organize my knowledge
- 😄 Meet and talk with new people
- 😑 Vent out

Writing is one of those skills that it's usually forgotten, but **it may cause a big impact in your career and life**. In the end, we collaborate and communicate every day. I develop UIs, but definitively, I spend a lot of time writing documents, syncing with my team and exposing ideas.

Continuing this healthy habit is the main reason of this new site.

## A cocktail

In the past, I also tried to keep topics separated in different blogs. However, keeping things up-to-date and being motivated to maintain 3 blogs was not easy. Many times my blogs ended up with a few articles and some little traffic.

As you may know, **my main focus is always around UIs**. However, I usually move a bit away from it and work on other things like backend, automation, deployment and UX. You can expect different topics like these in this blog.

Said that, **this is not only a professional site**. I will post also personal stuff like music, photography and illustration.

Hope you enjoy all the content and see you soon! 👋
