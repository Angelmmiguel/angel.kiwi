So, here we go again! 

New blog, new design and new content. This site was in my todo list for long time. Actually, I have to update the illustration in the home page as I changed my hair style 1 year ago. Many things happen during the last year (COVID, ejem), so I didnÂ´t find the energy and motivation to design and develop until now.

## Why a new blog in late 2021?

To be honest, I don't remember the last time I wrote an article for my previos blog and it's something I'm missing. Writing helped me a lot in the past. Every article brought me many good things:

* Improve English
* Learn new things
* Organize my knowledge
* Meet and talk with new people
* Vent out

Writing is one of those skills that it's usually forgotten, but **it may cause a big impact in your career and life**. In the end, we collaborate and communicate every day. I develop UIs, but definitively, I spend a lot of time writing documents, syncing with my team and exposing ideas. 

Continuing this healthy habit is the main reason of this new site.

## A cocktail 

In the past, I also tried to keep topics separated in different blogs. However, keeping things up-to-date and being motivated to maintain 3 blogs was not easy. Many times my blogs ended up with a few articles and some little traffic.

As you may know, my main focus is always around UIs. However, I usually move a bit away from it and work on other things like backend, automation, deployment and UX. You can expect different topics like these in this blog. I will try to keep them organized. If you found this blog because you were looking for a specific topic, you will other relevant articles to check. Said that, this is not only a professional site. I will post also personal stuff like music, photography and illustration. 

Hope you enjoy all the content and see you soon!
