Leaving a company is never an easy decision and this wasn't an exception. After 8 years (and two acquisitions), **I decided to leave Broadcom**.

What a journey! I grew a lot since I joined Bitnami back in 2016. During these years I worked on challenging projects, shiped several products, and met amazing people. I'm really grateful for all the experiences that helped me to grow personal and professionally.

# Looking back

In 2016, I started a new position as a Frontend Engineer in Bitnami. There, I joined the "webdev" team, contributing to the tools and platforms that have been used by millions of developers over these years. I remember the younger me was insecure and excited. My English level wasn't that good, but I quickly started getting better thanks to the team. 

In a startup, you need to iterate quickly. Sometimes, I was surprised by some changes on projects and direction. Over time, I learnt you need to adapt and make difficult decisions to continue growing. Even I was disappointed, **pivots were a great opportunity to learn new things, redefine the basics, and shine**.

Then, the VMware acquisition came in 2019. At that time, I didn't know anything about an acquisition process and working on a big company. VMware and later Broadcom, teached me how big companies work. In a startup you have a single strategy you can understand and align with. In a big company, there are many moving pieces and even you have a common strategy, groups apply them in a different way. **Define a strong vision, collaborate and influence others in a big company is critical for personal and project success**. This is the biggest learnt from the amazing leaders I worked with in VMware.

Regardless of my employeer, I always tried to keep curious and enjoy learning. **It's what makes me grow**. Since I started working back in 2014, I develop mobile applications, web services (frontend and backend), implement automations, establish metrics and alerts, deploy services on bare metal servers and Kubernetes, design and implement the UI of different products, publish OSS projects, collaborate with Marketing, Product, Accessibility and Engineering teams, etc, **and I hope this list continue expanding!** 

This motivation is what made me working lately on WebAssembly and Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a tech lead. **Driving a small team of engineers, building a community, and collaborate with a wider group was a tremendously enriching experience**. In less than 2 years I gaved 7 different talks in major conferences!

Looking back, I felt I grew a lot and that's a marvelous feeling ðŸ˜Š

# What's next?

That's "the question".

Fortunately, I have a response for it: **I don't know yet**. Any time I say this I feel relieved and scared. For now, I will take some time off, spend time with the family, explore some ideas, and contribute back to OSS. Knowing myself, this idea won't last too long, but for now I will try to claim some space to think about my next steps ðŸª„
